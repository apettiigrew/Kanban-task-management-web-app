# Task List: Task Management App Implementation

**Based on:** `prd-task-management.md`  
**Created:** May 30, 2025  
**Target:** Junior Developer Implementation Guide

## Overview

This task list implements a multi-project Kanban task management system with drag-and-drop functionality, built on Next.js with local storage persistence. All data operations are handled through TanStack Query for optimal performance, caching, and real-time updates.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: PERMISSION REQUIRED

**ALWAYS ask for PERMISSION before starting any new task. NEVER start a new task without explicit user approval.**

## üìã TASK COMPLETION WORKFLOW

**When completing tasks, follow this workflow:**
1. Complete the implementation work for the task
2. **WAIT** for the user to confirm the task is completed to their satisfaction
3. **ONLY AFTER** user confirmation, mark the task as completed with `[x]` in this document
4. **ONLY AFTER** marking as completed, create the git commit with an appropriate commit message
5. **NEVER** mark tasks as completed or create git commits without explicit user confirmation

This ensures quality control and allows the user to review and test implementations before they are considered "done".

### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `npm test` to run Jest tests for the project
- Use Shadcn UI components and Tailwind CSS for all UI elements
- Use Lucide React icons for all icon requirements
- Leverage existing drag-and-drop implementation from @atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop
- All data persistence handled through PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Use TanStack Query for all data fetching and mutations with proper caching and invalidation
- Form validation with React Hook Form and Zod schemas
- Server-side validation with Zod in API routes
- Implement optimistic updates for all mutations using TanStack Query
- Use TanStack Query's built-in error handling and loading states
