# Product Requirements Document (PRD) â€“ Task Management App

## Overview

Build a responsive, interactive task management application that supports both front-end and optionally full-stack functionality. The application will allow users to create, manage, and organize boards and tasks with robust interactivity and modern UI/UX practices.

## Goals

* Deliver a fully functional task management interface that closely matches the provided design.
* Ensure responsive design works across all screen sizes.
* Implement full CRUD functionality for boards and tasks.
* Provide state persistence and user-friendly experience enhancements.

## Target Audience

Individuals or teams looking for a simple, visually appealing task and project management solution.

## Key Features

### 1. Layout and Responsiveness

* Responsive layout adapting to mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
* Display the optimal layout based on screen size.

### 2. Interactivity and Usability

* Hover states for all interactive UI elements.
* Toggle between light and dark modes.
* Show/hide the board sidebar.

### 3. CRUD Operations

#### Boards

* Create a new board with title and columns.
* View existing boards.
* Edit board title or column names.
* Delete board with confirmation.

#### Tasks

* Create a task with title, description, subtasks, and assigned column.
* View task details in a modal.
* Edit existing tasks.
* Delete tasks with confirmation.
* Mark subtasks as complete.
* Move tasks between columns.

### 4. View Boards and Tasks

* View a list of all boards.
* Open a board to see its tasks organized by column.
* View task details including subtasks and completion status.

### 5. Bonus Features

* Drag and drop tasks to reorder within columns and to move between columns.
* Persist all data in localStorage for state retention between sessions (if not using a backend).
* Full-stack version (optional): Persist board and task data to a database.

### 6. Authentication

* Register, login, and logout functionality.
* Use JWT or NextAuth for session handling.
* Passwords must be hashed and stored securely.
* Access to app restricted to authenticated users only.

## Technical Requirements

* Data initially loaded from a local `data.json` file.
* Optional: Use a full-stack framework (e.g., Next.js, Express.js, etc.).
* LocalStorage or backend database (if full-stack) to persist state.
* Form validation on create/edit for boards and tasks.

## Tech Stack Suggestions

* Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
* Optional Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB/PostgreSQL
* Authentication: NextAuth.js or JWT with bcrypt

## Out of Scope

* Notifications or real-time collaboration.
* Advanced user permission levels.

## Milestones

1. Project scaffolding and UI layout
2. Implement data model and CRUD logic
3. Add responsive design and interactivity
4. Integrate authentication system
5. Bonus features (drag-and-drop, persistence)
6. Full-stack implementation (optional)
