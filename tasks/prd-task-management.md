# Product Requirements Document: Task Management App

## Introduction/Overview

The Task Management App is a productivity tool designed for individual professionals who need to organize, track, and manage tasks across multiple projects. The app provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface built on Kanban methodology, allowing users to visualize their workflow and update task progress seamlessly. 

**Problem Statement:** Individual professionals often struggle with scattered task management across different tools, lack of visual workflow representation, and inefficient task status updates. Current solutions are either too complex for individual use or lack the flexibility needed for diverse project types.

**Goal:** Create a streamlined, visual task management system that helps individual professionals organize their work efficiently, track progress intuitively, and maintain focus across multiple projects.

## Goals

1. **Improve Task Organization:** Enable users to organize tasks into logical project groups with visual boards
2. **Enhance Productivity:** Reduce time spent on task management overhead through intuitive drag-and-drop interactions
3. **Increase Visibility:** Provide clear visual representation of task status and project progress
4. **Maintain Focus:** Help users prioritize and track work across multiple concurrent projects
5. **Ensure Data Persistence:** Reliably store and synchronize task data across sessions

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories
1. **As an individual professional, I want to create separate projects so that I can organize tasks by context (work, personal, side projects)**
2. **As a user, I want to create tasks with titles and descriptions so that I can capture all necessary information**
3. **As a user, I want to drag tasks between different status columns so that I can quickly update progress without clicking through menus**
4. **As a user, I want to reorder tasks within columns so that I can prioritize my work**
5. **As a user, I want to reorder columns so that I can customize my workflow stages**

### Secondary User Stories
6. **As a user, I want to edit task details so that I can update information as requirements change**
7. **As a user, I want to delete completed or obsolete tasks so that I can keep my boards clean**
8. **As a user, I want to create and customize project boards so that I can adapt the tool to different types of work**
9. **As a user, I want to view all my projects in one place so that I can easily navigate between different areas of work**
10. **As a user, I want to create an account so that I can securely store my projects and access them from any device**
11. **As a user, I want to log in to my account so that I can access my personal task boards**
12. **As a user, I want to reset my password if I forget it so that I can regain access to my account**

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Multi-user collaboration:** No sharing, commenting, or real-time collaboration features

8. **Advanced reporting:** No analytics, charts, or progress reports
9. **Keyboard shortcuts:** Focus on mouse/touch interactions for v1
10. **Social features:** No user profiles, sharing, or social interactions beyond personal use

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Consistency:** Follow the existing kanban-app design patterns and component library
- **Visual Feedback:** Implement drag shadows and hover states similar to existing card functionality
- **Color Scheme:** Use the established color palette (blues for cards, emerald for columns)
- **Typography:** Maintain existing font hierarchy and sizing
- **Spacing:** Follow current grid system and spacing conventions

### Component Reuse
- Leverage existing components: `Column`, `CardTask`, `AddCardButton`, `DropdownMenu`
- Extend current CSS modules pattern for new components
- Build upon existing drag-and-drop implementation using @atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop

### Responsive Design
- Ensure boards remain usable on tablet-sized screens (768px+)
- Implement horizontal scrolling for boards with many columns
- Maintain touch-friendly interaction targets

## Technical Considerations

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15+ with React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling:** CSS Modules (no Tailwind per project standards)
- **Drag & Drop:** @atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop (already implemented)
- **State Management:** React Context API for board state
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js with email/password provider
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Data Storage:** Database for authenticated users, local storage for development/fallback

### Architecture
- Extend existing board context provider for multi-project support
- Implement project-level routing using Next.js app router
- Use existing data models as foundation, extend for project relationships
- Follow established error handling patterns with try/catch blocks
- Implement NextAuth.js for session management and authentication
- Use Prisma for database schema management and type-safe queries
- Implement API routes for authenticated CRUD operations

### Performance
- Support up to 20 projects per user
- Support up to 100 tasks per project
- Optimize drag operations for smooth 60fps interactions
- Implement lazy loading for project dashboard if needed

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface Project {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface Task {
  id: string;
  projectId: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  columnId: string;
  order: number;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface Column {
  id: string;
  projectId: string;
  title: string;
  order: number;
  tasks: Task[];
}
```

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
1. **User Engagement:** Users create at least 2 projects within first week
2. **Feature Adoption:** 80% of users utilize drag-and-drop functionality within first session
3. **Data Integrity:** 99% successful task position updates without data loss
4. **Performance:** Drag operations complete within 100ms on standard hardware

### Secondary Metrics
5. **User Retention:** Users return to app within 7 days of first use
6. **Task Completion:** Average of 5+ tasks moved to "Done" status per week per active user
7. **Project Utilization:** Average of 2-3 active projects per user
8. **Error Rate:** Less than 1% of drag operations result in errors

## Open Questions

1. **Default Project Structure:** Should new users start with a default project or empty state?
2. **Column Limits:** Is there a maximum number of columns per project we should enforce?
3. **Task Limits:** Should we implement any limits on tasks per column or project?
4. **Data Export:** Do users need ability to export project data (JSON, CSV)?
5. **Project Templates:** Would predefined project templates (Personal, Work, etc.) be valuable?
6. **Archiving:** Should completed projects be archived rather than deleted?
7. **Undo Functionality:** Is undo/redo for drag operations necessary for v1?
8. **Keyboard Navigation:** What level of keyboard accessibility is required?
