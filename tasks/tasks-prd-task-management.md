# Task List: Task Management App Implementation

Based on the Product Requirements Document for the Task Management App, this document outlines the implementation tasks required to build a multi-user task management system with authentication, project management, and drag-and-drop functionality.

## Relevant Files

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
